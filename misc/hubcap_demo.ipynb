We should strive for \"no manual needed\". \\r\\n\\r\\nI made the mistake, yet again, of letting what I was wrapping have to much influence on the design of my interface. \\r\\nIt\\'s okay, and even often desirable, to have a layer that is \"inner oriented\" (what I sometimes call the \"long language\"), \\r\\nbut we shouldn\\'t forget the domain-oriented interface in the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo what would I want the interface to be?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Root\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m considering something like, by default getting a mapping at the highest level of github (I\\'ll use `Hubcap` here, since `GithubReader` is already used in my code):\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ns = Hubcap()\\r\\nu = s[\\'thorwhalen\\']  # mapping of repos of thorwhalen\\r\\nlist(org)  # will list repos of thorwhalen user/org, for example\\r\\nr = u[\\'hubcap\\']  # mapping for the contents of the repo\\r\\n# etc.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, we can do:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nss = GithubReader()\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it will default to the user/org associated with the default login/token (the one used by the API). \\r\\n\\r\\nHere, `list(ss)` will list the repos for that user (we haven\\'t defined what `list(s)` would be yet), but what\\'s not nice is that you can\\'t start at the very top of github. Is that a problem? Should we consider that the user must start with specifying a user/org first? Maybe. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf `Hubcap` has any iter, what would it be? Obviously, we wouldn\\'t want to list all user/orgs. We could implement `__contains__` at that level, but listing all user/orgs (in list(s)) would result in a very long process. Perhaps we still default to the current user (as with GithubReader), or allow the user to specify a list of users/orgs to start with, or perhaps we list any org they\\'re part of and/or starred... \\r\\n\\r\\n## And then...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first level is user/org. Then there\\'s repos (but are there other choices). What next?\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now we have `branch` as being the next level -- but again, what are the other choices?\\r\\nThere are other resources associated with the user/org. Issues, discussions, wikis, etc.\\r\\nFurther, even having to specify branches is annoying -- we\\'d like to easily default to a branch and directly get to the files. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo the situation is that we have a tree -- something like (we\\'ll just say \"org\" instead of \"user/org\" from now on. \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nROOT\\r\\n  ORGS\\r\\n    REPOS\\r\\n       ACTIONS\\r\\n       ISSUES\\r\\n          COMMENTS\\r\\n             REPLIES\\r\\n       DISCUSSIONS\\r\\n          COMMENTS\\r\\n             REPLIES\\r\\n       WIKIS\\r\\n       ...\\r\\n       BRANCHES\\r\\n          COMMITS\\r\\n             FILES\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'d like to have access to all these resources, with a mapping interface of the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'d also like to have convenient mappings like `ORGS/REPOS/master/last_commit/FILES`. \\r\\n(Notice here that `master` is static, but `last_commit` is dynamic (it will change with time).)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a `hubcap` problem by the way, but a general `dol` one. See for example, the `py2store` [Hypercubic keys and slicing](https://github.com/i2mint/py2store/issues/33) issue and [this comment](https://github.com/i2mint/py2store/issues/33#issuecomment-1798158170) mentioning the hubcap use case.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

There must be a ledger that links a commit to the branch it was created on. I should read about the exact logic there! What does it mean as far a our dimensioned indexation schema goes? It seems we still need both a branch and a commit dimension since it\\'s a many-to-1 relationship: a branch may have several commits.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote also how we had \"tree\" when the path pointed to a folder, replaced by \"blob\" when it points to a file (so, unlike in unix, where [\"everything is a file\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file), a folder is not considered a file here?)\\r\\n\\r\\nMore...\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/wiki\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/wiki/Test-Wiki-A\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues/4\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues/4#issuecomment-1801792378\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1#discussioncomment-7509953\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1#discussioncomment-7509957  # it\\'s actually a comment \"reply\" here\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

       "'# Root interface of hubcap (#2)\\n\\nEvery time I need to do something with `hubcap` I need to look up how it works again. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s negative points for UX design right there! We should strive for \"no manual needed\". \\r\\n\\r\\nI made the mistake, yet again, of letting what I was wrapping have to much influence on the design of my interface. \\r\\nIt\\'s okay, and even often desirable, to have a layer that is \"inner oriented\" (what I sometimes call the \"long language\"), \\r\\nbut we shouldn\\'t forget the domain-oriented interface in the process. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo what would I want the interface to be?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Root\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m considering something like, by default getting a mapping at the highest level of github (I\\'ll use `Hubcap` here, since `GithubReader` is already used in my code):\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ns = Hubcap()\\r\\nu = s[\\'thorwhalen\\']  # mapping of repos of thorwhalen\\r\\nlist(org)  # will list repos of thorwhalen user/org, for example\\r\\nr = u[\\'hubcap\\']  # mapping for the contents of the repo\\r\\n# etc.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, we can do:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nss = GithubReader()\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it will default to the user/org associated with the default login/token (the one used by the API). \\r\\n\\r\\nHere, `list(ss)` will list the repos for that user (we haven\\'t defined what `list(s)` would be yet), but what\\'s not nice is that you can\\'t start at the very top of github. Is that a problem? Should we consider that the user must start with specifying a user/org first? Maybe. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf `Hubcap` has any iter, what would it be? Obviously, we wouldn\\'t want to list all user/orgs. We could implement `__contains__` at that level, but listing all user/orgs (in list(s)) would result in a very long process. Perhaps we still default to the current user (as with GithubReader), or allow the user to specify a list of users/orgs to start with, or perhaps we list any org they\\'re part of and/or starred... \\r\\n\\r\\n## And then...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first level is user/org. Then there\\'s repos (but are there other choices). What next?\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now we have `branch` as being the next level -- but again, what are the other choices?\\r\\nThere are other resources associated with the user/org. Issues, discussions, wikis, etc.\\r\\nFurther, even having to specify branches is annoying -- we\\'d like to easily default to a branch and directly get to the files. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo the situation is that we have a tree -- something like (we\\'ll just say \"org\" instead of \"user/org\" from now on. \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nROOT\\r\\n  ORGS\\r\\n    REPOS\\r\\n       ACTIONS\\r\\n       ISSUES\\r\\n          COMMENTS\\r\\n             REPLIES\\r\\n       DISCUSSIONS\\r\\n          COMMENTS\\r\\n             REPLIES\\r\\n       WIKIS\\r\\n       ...\\r\\n       BRANCHES\\r\\n          COMMITS\\r\\n             FILES\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'d like to have access to all these resources, with a mapping interface of the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\'d also like to have convenient mappings like `ORGS/REPOS/master/last_commit/FILES`. \\r\\n(Notice here that `master` is static, but `last_commit` is dynamic (it will change with time).)\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not a `hubcap` problem by the way, but a general `dol` one. See for example, the `py2store` [Hypercubic keys and slicing](https://github.com/i2mint/py2store/issues/33) issue and [this comment](https://github.com/i2mint/py2store/issues/33#issuecomment-1798158170) mentioning the hubcap use case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n## Comment\\n\\nFurther it would be nice if we could access resources via a url copied as is from viewing it on the browser. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s what the [hubcap.hub](https://github.com/thorwhalen/hubcap/blob/6d5d7b9813e068ef4bcf1e6b905cc2febd38e468/hubcap/tools.py#L18) function is intended to do -- and does, **at the time of writing this**, somewhat, partially, but with a terrible design and unreliable robustness (due to the fact that [RepoReader](https://github.com/thorwhalen/hubcap/blob/6d5d7b9813e068ef4bcf1e6b905cc2febd38e468/hubcap/base.py#L121) isn\\'t really finished. What is left to do there is finish completing the declarative configuration that is [dflt_repo_kwargs](https://github.com/thorwhalen/hubcap/blob/6d5d7b9813e068ef4bcf1e6b905cc2febd38e468/hubcap/base.py#L102) and make things recursive (e.g. when we do `issue = repo_reader[\\'issues\\'][3]`, `issue` should be a `Mapping` with it\\'s own key-value definition, which includes \"leaf\" properties (like title, creation date, etc.) as well as other nested mappings (such as comments). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Examples of github urls\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/tree/main/folder_1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\ncorresponds to \\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n{\"org\": \"thorwhalen\", \"repo\": \"test_repo\", \"branch\": \"main\", \"commit\": \"most_recent\", \"path\": \"folder_1/\"}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nwhose reduced form url could be\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nthorwhalen/test_repo/main/most_recent/folder_1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nor even (with a default interpretation that assumes commit=most_recent without confusing commit and path):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nthorwhalen/test_repo/main/folder_1\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote a few other urls (interpretation and pattern extraction left to the reader!):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/blob/main/folder_1/file_1_level_2 \\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/blob/117dded5171a23d465f7b3d6ae3204a4e105cfb2/folder_1/file_1_level_2 \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote how the branch doesn\\'t show when the commit hash is present. There must be a ledger that links a commit to the branch it was created on. I should read about the exact logic there! What does it mean as far a our dimensioned indexation schema goes? It seems we still need both a branch and a commit dimension since it\\'s a many-to-1 relationship: a branch may have several commits.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote also how we had \"tree\" when the path pointed to a folder, replaced by \"blob\" when it points to a file (so, unlike in unix, where [\"everything is a file\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file), a folder is not considered a file here?)\\r\\n\\r\\nMore...\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/wiki\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/wiki/Test-Wiki-A\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues/4\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/issues/4#issuecomment-1801792378\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1#discussioncomment-7509953\\r\\nhttps://github.com/thorwhalen/test_repo/discussions/1#discussioncomment-7509957  # it\\'s actually a comment \"reply\" here\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Dev notes for `hubcap` (#4)\\n\\nDev notes for `hubcap`\\n\\n## Comment\\n\\n# Manual Authentication Upload (for 2FA users)\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you have 2FA enabled on GitHub, use this approach where you log in manually first, then the script takes over.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Usage in Jupyter\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nfrom hubcap.scrap.social_preview import upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async\\r\\n\\r\\n# This will:\\r\\n# 1. Open a browser to GitHub login\\r\\n# 2. Wait for you to log in (including 2FA)\\r\\n# 3. Automatically navigate to settings and upload the image\\r\\n\\r\\nresult = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n    repo_full_name=\\'thorwhalen/graze\\',\\r\\n    image_path=\\'/Users/thorwhalen/Downloads/graze_image.png\\',\\r\\n    headless=False  # Must be False so you can see to log in\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Happens:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Browser opens** - You\\'ll see a browser window open to GitHub login\\r\\n2. **You log in** - Enter your username, password, and 2FA code manually\\r\\n3. **Script detects login** - Once you\\'re logged in, the script automatically continues\\r\\n4. **Automatic upload** - Script navigates to settings and uploads your image\\r\\n5. **Confirmation** - You\\'ll see success messages in your console\\r\\n\\r\\n## Full Example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport os\\r\\nfrom hubcap.scrap.social_preview import upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async\\r\\n\\r\\n# Upload with manual login\\r\\nprint(\"Starting upload process...\")\\r\\nprint(\"A browser will open - please log in to GitHub\")\\r\\n\\r\\nresult = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n    repo_full_name=\\'thorwhalen/graze\\',\\r\\n    image_path=\\'/Users/thorwhalen/Downloads/graze_image.png\\'\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\nif result:\\r\\n    print(\"\\\\n✓ Successfully uploaded social preview!\")\\r\\nelse:\\r\\n    print(\"\\\\n✗ Upload failed - check the error messages above\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Don\\'t close the browser** - Let the script control it after you log in\\r\\n- **Wait for automation** - After logging in, the script will automatically proceed\\r\\n- **Watch the console** - You\\'ll see status messages as the script works\\r\\n- **Admin access required** - Make sure you have admin rights to the repo\\r\\n\\r\\n## Batch Upload Multiple Repos:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nrepos_and_images = [\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/graze\\', \\'/path/to/graze_image.png\\'),\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/hubcap\\', \\'/path/to/hubcap_image.png\\'),\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/dol\\', \\'/path/to/dol_image.png\\'),\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Log in once, then upload to all repos\\r\\nprint(\"Please log in to GitHub in the browser that opens...\")\\r\\n\\r\\nfor repo_name, image_path in repos_and_images:\\r\\n    print(f\"\\\\n{\\'=\\'*60}\")\\r\\n    print(f\"Uploading to {repo_name}...\")\\r\\n    print(f\"{\\'=\\'*60}\")\\r\\n    \\r\\n    result = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n        repo_full_name=repo_name,\\r\\n        image_path=image_path\\r\\n    )\\r\\n    \\r\\n    if result:\\r\\n        print(f\"✓ {repo_name} - Success\")\\r\\n    else:\\r\\n        print(f\"✗ {repo_name} - Failed\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Troubleshooting:\\r\\n\\r\\n### \"Could not find Edit button\"\\r\\n- Make sure you have **admin access** to the repository\\r\\n- Try manually navigating to the settings page first to verify access\\r\\n\\r\\n### \"Could not find Social Preview section\"\\r\\n- The repo might not have the social preview feature enabled\\r\\n- Check if you can see it manually at `https://github.com/yourname/repo/settings`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Script times out during login\\r\\n- Default timeout is 3 minutes\\r\\n- Increase if needed: `timeout=300000` (5 minutes)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Browser closes too quickly\\r\\n- The browser stays open for 5 seconds after completion\\r\\n- You can manually keep it open longer if needed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Approach Works:\\r\\n\\r\\n✓ **Handles 2FA** - You enter your 2FA code manually  \\r\\n✓ **Handles passkeys** - Works with any auth method GitHub supports  \\r\\n✓ **Session-based** - Uses your actual browser session  \\r\\n✓ **One login** - Can upload to multiple repos with one login  \\r\\n✓ **Visual feedback** - You can see exactly what\\'s happening  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the most reliable approach for accounts with 2FA enabled!\\r\\n\\n\\n'"

Open a browser to GitHub login\\r\\n# 2. Wait for you to log in (including 2FA)\\r\\n# 3. Automatically navigate to settings and upload the image\\r\\n\\r\\nresult = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n    repo_full_name=\\'thorwhalen/graze\\',\\r\\n    image_path=\\'/Users/thorwhalen/Downloads/graze_image.png\\',\\r\\n    headless=False  # Must be False so you can see to log in\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## What Happens:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Browser opens** - You\\'ll see a browser window open to GitHub login\\r\\n2. **You log in** - Enter your username, password, and 2FA code manually\\r\\n3. **Script detects login** - Once you\\'re logged in, the script automatically continues\\r\\n4. **Automatic upload** - Script navigates to settings and uploads your image\\r\\n5. **Confirmation** - You\\'ll see success messages in your console\\r\\n\\r\\n## Full Example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport os\\r\\nfrom hubcap.scrap.social_preview import upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async\\r\\n\\r\\n# Upload with manual login\\r\\nprint(\"Starting upload process...\")\\r\\nprint(\"A browser will open - please log in to GitHub\")\\r\\n\\r\\nresult = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n    repo_full_name=\\'thorwhalen/graze\\',\\r\\n    image_path=\\'/Users/thorwhalen/Downloads/graze_image.png\\'\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\nif result:\\r\\n    print(\"\\\\n✓ Successfully uploaded social preview!\")\\r\\nelse:\\r\\n    print(\"\\\\n✗ Upload failed - check the error messages above\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Tips:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Don\\'t close the browser** - Let the script control it after you log in\\r\\n- **Wait for automation** - After logging in, the script will automatically proceed\\r\\n- **Watch the console** - You\\'ll see status messages as the script works\\r\\n- **Admin access required** - Make sure you have admin rights to the repo\\r\\n\\r\\n## Batch Upload Multiple Repos:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nrepos_and_images = [\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/graze\\', \\'/path/to/graze_image.png\\'),\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/hubcap\\', \\'/path/to/hubcap_image.png\\'),\\r\\n    (\\'thorwhalen/dol\\', \\'/path/to/dol_image.png\\'),\\r\\n]\\r\\n\\r\\n# Log in once, then upload to all repos\\r\\nprint(\"Please log in to GitHub in the browser that opens...\")\\r\\n\\r\\nfor repo_name, image_path in repos_and_images:\\r\\n    print(f\"\\\\n{\\'=\\'*60}\")\\r\\n    print(f\"Uploading to {repo_name}...\")\\r\\n    print(f\"{\\'=\\'*60}\")\\r\\n    \\r\\n    result = await upload_social_preview_with_manual_auth_async(\\r\\n        repo_full_name=repo_name,\\r\\n        image_path=image_path\\r\\n    )\\r\\n    \\r\\n    if result:\\r\\n        print(f\"✓ {repo_name} - Success\")\\r\\n    else:\\r\\n        print(f\"✗ {repo_name} - Failed\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Troubleshooting:\\r\\n\\r\\n### \"Could not find Edit button\"\\r\\n- Make sure you have **admin access** to the repository\\r\\n- Try manually navigating to the settings page first to verify access\\r\\n\\r\\n### \"Could not find Social Preview section\"\\r\\n- The repo might not have the social preview feature enabled\\r\\n- Check if you can see it manually at `https://github.com/yourname/repo/settings`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Script times out during login\\r\\n- Default timeout is 3 minutes\\r\\n- Increase if needed: `timeout=300000` (5 minutes)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Browser closes too quickly\\r\\n- The browser stays open for 5 seconds after completion\\r\\n- You can manually keep it open longer if needed\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why This Approach Works:\\r\\n\\r\\n✓ **Handles 2FA** - You enter your 2FA code manually  \\r\\n✓ **Handles passkeys** - Works with any auth method GitHub supports  \\r\\n✓ **Session-based** - Uses your actual browser session  \\r\\n✓ **One login** - Can upload to multiple repos with one login  \\r\\n✓ **Visual feedback** - You can see exactly what\\'s happening  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the most reliable approach for accounts with 2FA enabled!\\r\\n',\n",
